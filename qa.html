            <h2 class="qa-question">Is anxiety normal?</h2>
            <div class="qa-answer">
              <p>Yes. Anxiety is a normal, natural response to stress. Everyone experiences it sometimes—before a test, when meeting new people, or facing something unfamiliar. What matters is whether it gets in the way of daily life. If anxiety feels overwhelming, persistent, or interferes with school, sleep, or relationships, it's worth talking to someone about it. You're not "weak" for feeling anxious, and it's okay to ask for support.</p>

          <article class="qa-item">
            <h2 class="qa-question">How do I help a friend?</h2>
            <div class="qa-answer">
              <p>Start by being there. Listen without judging, give them space to talk, and avoid dismissing their feelings. You don't have to have answers—often, just being present matters most. Gently suggest they talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or professional if they're struggling. Offer to go with them if that feels easier. Be patient: people open up in their own time. And take care of yourself too—supporting a friend can be tiring, so it's okay to set boundaries and reach out for support yourself.</p>

          <article class="qa-item">
            <h2 class="qa-question">What if I'm scared to ask for help?</h2>
            <div class="qa-answer">
              <p>That fear is very common. Asking for help can feel scary because it makes you feel vulnerable, or because you worry about being judged. Remember: seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You can start small—maybe confide in a teacher, counselor, parent, or friend you trust. You don't have to share everything at once. Many people feel relieved once they reach out, because they realize they don't have to go through it alone. It's okay to take your time, but know that support is available when you're ready.</p>
